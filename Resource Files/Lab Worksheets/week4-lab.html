<h1>Scientific Computing and Simulation, Lab 4: An attempt at sky imaging</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
In this lab we will try to apply the principles of imaging from
radiointerformetry data.  The visibilities data set we work from is real,
but I fear slightly uninspiring in terms the image it yields.
Nevertheless the principles apply to more interesting data (up to and
including the iconic M87* black hole image).
</p>

<h2>A simple imaging program</h2>

<p>
As in the past few weeks, I will give you a head start by providing an outline
program.  Please download the Java file
<a href="/Lab Work/Week 4/Imaging.java">Imaging.java</a>.
</p>

<p>
The main method of the main class in this file looks like this:
</p><pre>    public static void main(String [] args) throws IOException {

        float reVis, imVis ;
        float U, V ;

        // Read data from "vis-and-uv.txt"

        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("vis-and-uv.txt"))) ;

        // FT of visibilities

        double rawImage [] [] = new double [N] [N] ;
        double dirtyBeam [] [] = new double [N] [N] ;

        int k = 0 ;

        DisplayUV display1 = new DisplayUV(15000.0f) ;

        while(true) {

            String line = in.readLine() ;
            if(line == null) break ;

            String [] fields = line.split("\\s+") ;

            float XXAmp = Float.parseFloat(fields [0]) ;
            float XXPhs = Float.parseFloat(fields [1]) ;
            float XYAmp = Float.parseFloat(fields [2]) ;
            float XYPhs = Float.parseFloat(fields [3]) ;
            float YXAmp = Float.parseFloat(fields [4]) ;
            float YXPhs = Float.parseFloat(fields [5]) ;
            float YYAmp = Float.parseFloat(fields [6]) ;
            float YYPhs = Float.parseFloat(fields [7]) ;
            float u = Float.parseFloat(fields [8]) ;
            float v = Float.parseFloat(fields [9]) ;

            double XXPhsRad = Math.PI * (XXPhs / 180) ;
            double YYPhsRad = Math.PI * (YYPhs / 180) ;

            // Take sum of XX and YY polarizations
            reVis = (float) (XXAmp * Math.cos(XXPhsRad) +
                             YYAmp * Math.cos(YYPhsRad)) ;
            imVis = (float) (XXAmp * Math.sin(XXPhsRad) +
                             YYAmp * Math.sin(YYPhsRad)) ;

            U = u / WAVELENGTH ;
            V = v / WAVELENGTH ;

            display1.addPoint(U, V) ;

            for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
                double l = (i - N / 2) * CELL ;

                for (int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
                    double m = (j - N / 2) * CELL ;

                    double arg = 2 * Math.PI * (l * U + m * V) ;
                    double cos = Math.cos(arg) ;
                    double sin = Math.sin(arg) ;

                    rawImage  [i] [N - j - 1] += reVis * cos - imVis * sin ;
                    dirtyBeam [i] [N - j - 1] += cos ;
                }
            }

            k++ ;
            if(k % 10000 == 0) {
                System.out.println("k = " + k) ;
                display1.repaint() ;
            }
        }

        // Plot image

        DisplayDensity display2 =
                new DisplayDensity(rawImage, N, "Dirty image") ;

        // Plot dirty beam

        DisplayDensity display3 =
                new DisplayDensity(dirtyBeam, N,
                                   "Point spread function") ;
    }
</pre>
(The file <tt>Imaging.java</tt> also contains the definition of a
class <i>DiplayUV</i>, used to display coverage of the <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>
plane in the input data set.)<p></p>

<p>
We will be calculaing the inverse Fourier transform of some visiblities
read, together with their corresponding <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> values, from lines
of a file.</p>

<p>
As presented on slide 17 of this week's lecture, this transform is a
sum over <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> values, for each pixel <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>
(corresponding to some pair of direction cosines <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>).  But
the structure of the input data suggests dealing with <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>
values in the <i>outermost</i> loop (which reads lines containing
<i>u</i>, <i>v</i> values from the input file).  Then <i>inner</i>
loops over <i>i</i>, <i>j</i> accumulate contributions from this
<i>u</i>, <i>v</i> pair to every pixel <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>.</p>

<p>
This arrangement will also facilitate optimization of the inner loops,
because they loop over regularly spaced <i>l</i>, <i>m</i> values, whereas
<i>u</i>, <i>v</i> are irregularly spaced and less amenable to simple
optimizations.
It is always a good idea to make <i>inner</i> loops easy to optimize.</p>

<p>
So the main <tt>while(true)</tt> loop is reading lines from the input
file "vis-and-uv.txt".  It splits each line into separate fields and extracts
visibilities and <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> values from these fields.</p>

<p>
This is actually a LOFAR data set, and it turns out there are <i>four</i>
complex visibilities corresponding to four possible polarizations of
the radio waves received.  We just consider an overall unpolarized signal
by adding together XX and YY components of polarization, which is what
is computed in the assignment to <i>reVis</i> and <i>imVis</i> (the
input file represents the complex numbers by their separate amplitudes
and phases).</p>

<p>
The inner loops over <i>i</i>, <i>j</i> deal with the range of values
of the angular variable <i>l</i> and <i>m</i> in the image.  These
loops should look similar to other loops we have seen calculating Fourier
transforms in previous weeks.  The array <tt>rawImage</tt> accumulates the
inverse Fourier transform of the visibilites.  The array <tt>dirtyBeam</tt>
accumulates the "dirty beam" as defined on slide 24 of the lecture.</p>

<p>
Download the input file <a href="/Lab Work/Week 4/vis-and-uv.txt">vis-and-uv.txt</a>.
This could take some time because it is a 100MB file.  It contains
the better part of 2 million lines, each corresponding to a single reading.</p>

<p>
The program uses the support class <tt>DisplayDensity</tt> provided in
week 1.  I suggest you edit this to set <tt>CELL_SIZE = 4</tt>, otherwise
the displayed images will look rather small.</p>

<p>
You should now be able to run the <tt>Imaging</tt> program as it stands.
The drawback is that it will be very slow, and may not finish before the
end of the lab session.</p>

<p>
As it runs the program displays the <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> coverage of entries read
so far.  The file seems to be arranged in chronological order of when the
readings were taken, so you should be able to see this coverage steadily
improve as the Earth rotates.</p>

<!--
<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>
The program effectively uses naive Discrete Fourier Transforms.  As mentioned
in the lecture, a production code will probably project <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>
readings onto a regular grid and use FFTs, leading to much better performance.
But the projections here involve non-trivial interpolation techniques and
are outside our scope.</p>

<p>
However the time for execution of the provided <tt>Imaging</tt> class is
dominated by computation of trig functions in the body of the innermost
loop, and we can at least reduce this overhead dramatically.</p>

<p>
Note that within the innermost <i>j</i> loop, the trig functions are
effectively computing a geometric series in powers of an imaginary
exponential.  We can use this observation to replace each pair of
<i>cos</i>, <i>sin</i> evaluations by one complex multiplication.</p>

<p>
Replace the inner <i>i</i>, <i>j</i> loops by code like this:
<pre>
            double delArg = 2 * Math.PI * CELL * V ;
            double multRe = Math.cos(delArg) ;
            double multIm = Math.sin(delArg) ;
            for (int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++) {
                double l = (i - N / 2) * CELL ;
                double m0 = -(N / 2) * CELL ;
                double arg = 2 * Math.PI * (l * U + m0 * V) ;
                double expRe = Math.cos(arg) ;
                double expIm = Math.sin(arg) ;

                for (int j = 0 ; j < N ; j++) {

                    rawImage [i] [N - j - 1] += reVis * expRe - imVis * expIm ;
                    dirtyBeam [i] [N - j - 1] += expRe ;

                    <span style="color:red">... replace complex number exp by mult * exp ...</span>
                }
            }
</pre>
I have left you to fill in the code that multiplies <tt>exp</tt>
by <tt>mult</tt>.  These are complex numbers represented in the code
by real and imaginary parts <tt>expRe</tt>, <tt>expIm</tt> and <tt>multRe</tt>,
<tt>multIm</tt> respectively.  Use the formulae for complex multiplication
given on slide 27 of lecture 1, and remember you will have to use temporaries
for storing the old values of <tt>exp</tt> before overwriting them.</p>

<p>
I found the new version of the program was about an order of magnitude
faster.</p>

<h2>Postscript</h2>

<p>
The image you produce is likely to be slightly non-descript and
disappointing.</p>

<p>
I inherited this dataset from a Ph.D. student who was working with the
LOFAR team a few years ago.  Unfortunately I think the measurement set he
downloaded from LOFAR may not have been the proper data for this group
of sky observations.</p>

<p>
I am pretty happy that our simple processing of the data is sound,
because I have loaded the same measurement set into
<a href="https://casa.nrao.edu/">CASA</a>, a standard software package
used by astronomers for imaging and other tasks.  That gives the following
image:</p>
<p>
<img src="./week4-lab_files/Casa-image.PNG" height="400">
</p>
<p>
This has recognizably the same structure as output from our <tt>Imaging</tt>
program.
</p>
<p>
But while preparing this lab script I found a
<a href="https://www.astron.nl/lofarscience2011/presentations/Day02_Broderick.pdf">publication from LOFAR</a>
that happens to contain an image of the same area of sky, and it looks
completely different (and much more interesting):</p>
<p>
<img src="./week4-lab_files/Bell-Broderick-Image.PNG" height="400">
</p>
<p>
The position of the central "swirl" of our image does closely match
that of the strongest source in the official version (in the upper
left quadrant).  But otherwise we have lost all detail.</p>

<p></p>
As I said, I suspect my student downloaded a measurement set that was
perhaps uncalibrated data or perhaps some kind of subtraction or residual
byproduct of the proper processing.<p></p>

<p>
Unfortunately I no longer have any direct way to access LOFAR data.
But there are now many public data and science archives from radio
telescopes where it should be possible to download more interesting
visibility data.  In principle it should just be a matter of converting
this data to a readable format... sadly I ran out of time for
this practical.</p>

<p>
By the way the text file "vis-and-uv.txt" was extracted from an original
CASA format measurement set using the CASA <i>listvis</i> task.
I had to truncate the last 5% of the file to fit the text file into the 100MB
upload limit of Moodle!</p>
