<h1>Scientific Computing and Simulation, Lab 3: Inverting the Radon Transform</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
A CT scanner initially yields a certain projection of the density distribution
in a slice through a subject (usually a human).  Mathematically, what is
measured by the X-Ray detectors is (trivially related to) a <i>Radon transform</i>
of that density function.  The problem of forming an image of the interior
of the subject is then a matter of <i>inverting</i> the Radon transform.
</p>

<p>
This week I will give you a simulated density distribution for the interior
of a subject's skull, and from that derive the Radon transform - which
we present as a <i>sinogram</i>.  Then the main challenge is to reverse
that process to recover the original model from the sinogram (or Radon
transform).</p>

<h2>The Given Program</h2>

<p>
To give you a head start I will provide one new support class and a starting
point for your main program.</p>

<p>
The new support class, which will be useful later, is
<a href="/Lab Work/Week 3/DisplaySinogramFT/">DisplaySinogramFT</a>.  This is almost
identical to the class Display2dFT you used in the last two weeks,
except it is slightly tailored to work better when the Fourier transform
displayed only applies in one of two dimensions (the innermost index of
the two dimensional Java array provided - or the vertical axis on the
display).</p>

<p>
The starting point for your main program is in the class
<a href="/Lab Work/Week 3/Sinogram/">Sinogram</a>.  Its main method looks like this:
</p><pre>    static final float GREY_SCALE_LO = 0.95f, GREY_SCALE_HI = 1.05f ;
        // Clipping, for display only.  See for example Figure 1 in:
        //    http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/shepplogan/

    public static void main(String [] args) {

        double [] [] density = new double [N] [N] ;

        for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
            double x = SCALE * (i - N/2) ;
            for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
                double y = SCALE * (j - N/2) ;

                density [i] [j] = sheppLoganPhantom(x, y) ;
            }
        }

        DisplayDensity display1 =
                new DisplayDensity(density, N, "Source Model",
                                   GREY_SCALE_LO, GREY_SCALE_HI) ;

        // Radon tranform of density (as measured by detectors):

        double [] [] sinogram = new double [N] [N] ;

        for(int iTheta = 0 ; iTheta &lt; N ; iTheta++) {
            double theta = (Math.PI * iTheta) / N ;
            double cos = Math.cos(theta) ;
            double sin = Math.sin(theta) ;
            for(int iR = 0 ; iR &lt; N ; iR++) {
                double r = SCALE * (iR - N/2) ;
                double sum = 0 ;
                for(int iS = 0 ; iS &lt; N ; iS++) {
                    double s = SCALE * (iS - N/2) ;
                    double x = r * cos + s * sin ;
                    double y = r * sin - s * cos ;
                    sum += sheppLoganPhantom(x, y) ;
                }
                sinogram [iTheta] [iR] = sum ;
            }
        }

        DisplayDensity display2 = new DisplayDensity(sinogram, N, "Sinogram") ;

        // inferred integral of density points (actually sum of density
        // points, here) for laternormalization of reconstruction

        double normDensity = norm1(sinogram [0]) ;


        <span style="color:red">// ... Insert sinogram filtering code here! ...</span>


        double [] [] backProjection = new double [N] [N] ;
        backProject(backProjection, sinogram) ;

        // Normalize reconstruction, to have same sum as inferred for
        // original density

        double factor = normDensity / norm2(backProjection) ;
        for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
            for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
                backProjection [i] [j] *= factor ;
            }
        }

        DisplayDensity display5 =
                new DisplayDensity(backProjection, N,
                                   "Back projected sinogram") ;
    }
</pre>
You can initially run this code as it is.  It should pop up initially
a "source model", which is the model of a slice through a body that we are
simulating.  Then a little later the calculated sinogram will appear.
Finally it will pop up a window of the "backprojected sinogram", which
corresponds to the "pure" backpropagation approach to reconstruction
discussed in the lecture - an intuitive but mathematically crude approach
to image reconstruction.<p></p>

<p>
Before refining the image reconstruction, you will need some explanation of
the parts of this program.</p>

<p>
The "source model" here is a famous test image used in medical image
reconstruction.  It is called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepp%E2%80%93Logan_phantom">Shepp
Logan Phantom</a>.  It represents a cross section of a head, with 
enlosing skull, brain, and structures within the brain.  Densities
within the model are quite realistic, with the skull having density
2 (twice the density of water) and all other internal structures having
density close to one.</p>

<p>
Mathematically the phantom is built up from a series of ellipses layered
on top of one another, with some having positive and some negative
contribution (but such that the total density at any point inside the
skull is close to one).</p>

<p>
If you google for sites that discus numerical inversion of the Radon
tranform, you will find many of them use something that <i>looks</i> like
the Shepp Logan Phantom as their case study.  But beware that many of these
sites grossly simplify the problem by using much more widely varying
densities, so that a <i>linear</i> gray scale image looks similar to our
rendering of the source model.  But, in our display of the source
model, the grey scale has been clipped so that anything with density below
0.95 looks black and anything about 1.05 looks white.  With a linear grey
scale, the internal structures would be barely visible.  Reconstructing
structures with such small differences in density is a real challenge.</p>

<p>
The first section of the main code calculates an array <tt>density</tt>
of values of the model, purely so it can be displayed (you will need
to import the class DisplayDensity given in earlier weeks).
</p>

<p>
The next section of the code calculates the Radon tranform, approximating
the mathematical integral of the model density using sums along a path
at angle <i>θ</i>, and perpendicular distance <i>r</i> from the
origin.  So this section of code is simulating the actual process of
doing a CT scan.  The simulated output of the detectors is recorded in the
array called <tt>sinogram</tt>.  This two dimensional array (first index
corresponding to <i>θ</i>, second to <i>r</i>) is then plotted.
This looks a little like, and indeed corresponds to, traditional
hard-to-interpret X-ray images you may have seen.</p>

<p>
Then we make a naive attempt at image reconstruction using pure backprojection.
You should take a quick look at the method <tt>backProject</tt> in
<a href="/Lab Work/Week 3/Sinogram/">Sinogram</a>.  As explained in the lecture,
it is an integral over theta, approximated here as a discrete sum.  Simple
linear interpretation in the <i>r</i> dimension is used to estimate
the value of the Radon transform from measured points neighbouring
each required point.</p>

<p>
Before displaying the reconstruction <tt>backProjection</tt>, one final
step normalize it to have the same "norm" as the original density.
Here the norm is
defined as the sum or integral of the density over the whole region of
space containing the subject.  In a real situation we don't know this
norm for the subject in advance; but luckily we can easily extract it
from the measured Radon transform, as done here.</p>
<p></p>



<h2>Filtered Back Projection</h2>

<p>
Fill in the code omitted above that filters the sinogram using FFTs,
before backprojection.
For this you should use the class <tt>FFT</tt> provided last week.</p>

<p>
The first stage will be to calculate the complex Fourier transform of
the sinogram, transforming in the innermost <i>r</i> array subscript
only.
</p>

<p>
This should be rather straightforward.  Here is some skeleton code:
</p><pre>        double [] [] sinogramFTRe = new double [N] [N],
                     sinogramFTIm = new double [N] [N] ;
        for(int iTheta = 0 ; iTheta &lt; N ; iTheta++) {
            for(int iR = 0 ; iR &lt; N ; iR++) {
                sinogramFTRe [iTheta] [iR] = sinogram [iTheta] [iR] ;
            }
        }

        for(int iTheta = 0 ; iTheta &lt; N ; iTheta++) {
             <span style="color:red">... do 1D FFT on a row ...</span>
        }

        DisplaySinogramFT display3 =
                new DisplaySinogramFT(sinogramFTRe, sinogramFTIm, N,
                                      "Sinogram radial Fourier Transform") ;
</pre>
This should be somewhat simpler than the uses of <tt>fft1d()</tt> last
week, because
you are only transforming the <i>inner</i> dimension of the 2d array;
only single calls to the FFT, and no need for any transposes.
<p></p>

<p>
The second stage is to apply a filter to the rows of Fourier transform.
For simplicity you can do this in place on the arrays <tt>sinogramFTRe</tt>,
<tt>sinogramFTIm</tt>.  So you need a loop something like this:
</p><pre>        for(int iTheta = 0 ; iTheta &lt; N ; iTheta++) {
            for(int iK = 0 ; iK &lt; N ; iK++) {
                int kSigned = iK &lt;= N/2 ? iK : iK - N ;
                <span style="color:red">... multiply Sinogram FT by abs(kSigned) ...</span>
            }
        }
</pre>
Remember to take the <i>absolute</i> value of <tt>kSigned</tt>, and
multiply elements of both <tt>sinogramFTRe</tt>,
<tt>sinogramFTIm</tt> by this number.<p></p>

<p>
We came across the definition <tt>kSigned</tt> in week 1 lecture and labs.</p>

<p>
<i>Now, in another loop over <tt>iTheta</tt>, invert the FFT on the
sinogram</i>.  Again you can do this "in place" if you wish - no need to
declare any new complex arrays here.  (Hint: you already wrote the code
to do this - just change a 1 to a -1!)</p>

<p>
After completing this filtering, you can display the filtered sinogram by
something like:
</p><pre>        DisplayDensity display5 =
                new DisplayDensity(sinogramFTRe, N, "Filtered sinogram") ;
</pre>
(Now we have done the in place inverse FT, of course,
<tt>sinogramFTRe</tt> is no longer a Fourier transform - it is the
filtered sinogram in real space variables.)
<p></p>

<p>
If you do things this way, only other change to original main method given
above is that this line:
</p><pre>        backProject(backProjection, sinogram) ;
</pre>
should change to:
<pre>        backProject(backProjection, sinogramFTRe) ;
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The reconstructed image as displayed will be much sharper than the
original version using pure backprojection, but you will have difficulty
making out the internal structures of our "brain".  This is because
we used a linear gray scale.</p>

<p>
So finally change the lines:
</p><pre>        DisplayDensity display5 =
                new DisplayDensity(backProjection, N,
                                   "Back projected sinogram") ;
</pre>
to:
<pre>        DisplayDensity display5 =
                new DisplayDensity(backProjection, N,
                                   "Back projected sinogram",
                                   GREY_SCALE_LO, GREY_SCALE_HI) ;
</pre>
and run the program again.<p></p>

<p>
Now unfortunately you will see a lot of noise in the reconstructed image.
But you should be able to identify the main structures from the original
model.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>
The raw <i>|K|</i> filter we have used is called a "ramp filter".
In practice a variety of different filters are used to try to reduce
noise in the image.</p>

<p>
For example the <i>Ram Lak Filter</i> multiplies the FT by <i>|K|</i>
but also zeros components with <i>|K|</i> greater than some <tt>CUTOFF</tt>.
Try this with <tt>CUTOFF</tt> set to <i>N/4</i>.</p>

<p>
A <i>Low Pass Cosine Filter</i> multiplies the FT by:
</p><pre>    |<i>K</i>| cos(π<i>K</i>/(2 CUTOFF))
</pre>
and also sets the components to zero for <i>|K|</i> greater than
<tt>CUTOFF</tt>.  Try this with the same or other cutoffs.<p></p>

<p>
Real CT scanners will also use iterative improvement of the basic
reconstructions we have considered.  Unfortunately this is beyond the
scope of this module.</p>
