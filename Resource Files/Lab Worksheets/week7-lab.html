<h1>Scientific Computing and Simulation, Lab 7: A Lattice Boltzmann Model</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
This week you will be provided with a sample of a Lattice Boltzmann code
simulating two-dimensional fluid flow around a "cylindrical" (i.e. circular)
obstacle.  You will be asked to perform some simple optimizations on this
code, then experiment further with the parameters of the simulation.</p>

Most of the ellided code is related to the implementation of boundary
conditions ("BC code").  You will notice that there is rather a lot of
this code.  Boundary conditions include the behaviour of the fluid at
the inlet (<span style="color:blue"><i>x</i> = 0</span>), behaviour at
the outlet
(<span style="color:blue"><i>x</i> = <i>NX</i> - 1</span>), and its behaviour
in the
neighbourhood of the cylindrical obstacle sitting in the flow.  Tacitly there
is also a periodic boundary condition (of the kind we have seen in cellular
automata before) connecting the top and bottom of the display - this
is manifested in modulo operations in the streaming step.<p></p>

<p>
We haven't yet discussed boundary conditions in Lattice Boltzmann models,
and you can safely ignore this code until after we have discussed these
matters next week.</p>

<p>
Of the remaining code, you will note that the body of the main loop has
three main phases:
</p><ol>
<li>
calculation of the macroscopic density and flow velocity,
based on the population of "microscopic" states defined by <tt>fin</tt>,
</li><li>
the collision step, including calculation of equilibrium distribution, to
calculate <tt>fout</tt>, and</li>
<li>
the streaming step, which defines new values in <tt>fin</tt>.</li>
</ol>
<p>

</p><p>
The code in the body of the loop that calculates the "macroscopic
quantities" is based on the formulae on slide 12 of the lecture (at
least in the main <tt>i &gt; 0</tt> branch).  Check you understand what is
going on here.</p>

<p>
The code in the loop for the collision step calculates the equilibrium
distribution for the prevailing density and flow velocity using
the method <tt>equilibrim</tt>, then applies the update given on
slide 14.  You will recognize that <tt>omega</tt> is
<span style="color:blue">1 / τ</span>.</p>

<p>
The <tt>equilibrium</tt> method applies the formula on slide 15,
using the weights calculated earlier and the fact that 
<span style="color:blue"><i>c<sub>s</sub></i><sup>2</sup> = 1/3</span>.</p>

<p>
The streaming step uses the velocity vectors precomputed in the array
<tt>c</tt> and applies periodic boundary conditions (although these
conditions in the <i>x</i> direction at inlet and outlet are overridden
by "BC" code elsewhere in the program).</p>

<h2>Running the Code</h2>

<p>
Run the code provided for 5000 iterations (<tt>NITER = 5000</tt>).</p>

<p>
What will be displayed is the velocity of the flow.  Red means fast flow,
blue means slow (which may include fluid at rest).  To give
an impression of flow direction, a coarser grid is superimposed,
displaying "tags" whose length and direction are proportional to the
flow vector.</p>

<p>
In the initial state the fluid is in equilibrium at rest.  Then fluid
starts flowing in from the inlet at the
left.  You may spot various sound waves bouncing around before the
system settles down into a more continuous flow.</p>

<p>
Soon a pattern of initial steady flow is established, where you may be
able to identify a symmetric pair of vortices attached immediately
downstream of the obstacle - one on top of the other.  These vortices
gradually get stretched into elongated ovals.</p>

<p>
This should be the situation when the simulation finishes at 5000
iterations.</p>

<p>
Before trying to get further into the simulation, I want you to optimize
the code.</p>

<p>
At four places in the schematic code above there are loops over the
9 velocity states.  They have loop headers like this:
</p><pre>        for(int d = 0; d &lt; Q ; d++) {
</pre>
In the provided code these four loops are followed by commented out
sections of code starting with comments like this:
<pre>        // UNROLLED version of above loop over d
</pre>
<i>Loop unrolling</i> is an often powerful form of optimization in
scientific and high performance computing.  It consists of taking
a performance-critical inner loop of a program and partially or
completely replacing the loop with an inline sequence of operations,
repeating the loop body some constant number of times.  This at
least reduces overheads of branching and looping.<p></p>

<p>
In the examples here it is particularly effective because the <i>d</i>
loops only repeat 9 times and it practical to unroll the whole of these
loops.  Moreover if we are willing to specialize to a particular set
of velocity states, like D2Q9 here, we can then replace <tt>c</tt> and
<tt>w</tt> elements with their known, constant values, leading to
further simplifications.</p>

<p>
Comment out the four loops over <i>d</i>, uncomment the unrolled
versions, and run the code again.</p>

<p>
Does the code go faster, and if so by how much?</p>

<p>
Now ramp up the iteration count to say 30,000 or 40,000, and watch
the simulation unfold further.</p>

<p>
After 5,000 steps, the two vortices in the wake of the obstacle should
continue to deform.   Then, at around 15,000 steps the flow pattern should
start to destabilize, and the obstacle should start to "shed" the deformed
vortices in its wake.  These disappear downstream, and a new "order" should
eventually establish itself, in which successive
pairs of alternating clockwise and anticlockwise
vortices are shed at regular intervals.  This is called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_vortex_street">von
Karman vortex street</a></p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>Experiment further with your code.</p>

<p>
You may want to increase the lattice size, or change the size or shape
of the obstacle.  You can also, for example, change the incident flow
velocity and the Reynolds Number (we will discuss this more next week).</p>

<p>
As a slightly more challenging exercise, you may want to make a
thread-parallel version of the code, to see if you can speed up the code
or get to larger system sizes.  You will need two barrier synchronizations
in your main loop.  Can you tell where they should go?
