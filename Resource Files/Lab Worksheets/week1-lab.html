<h1>Scientific Computing and Simulation, Lab 1: Fourier Tranforms for Image Filtering</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
This week and the next couple of weeks we will be looking
at the uses of Fourier analysis in filtering and reconstructing images -
I hope to cover examples from medical and astronomical imaging.
</p>

<p>
In this first week I will ask you to code up a naive two-dimensional
Discrete Fourier Transform based on formulae in the lecture, and apply
it to simple filtering of a sample image.</p>

<h2>Some Support Classes</h2>

<p>
To give you a chance of completing this task in the time we have in the
lab, I will provide a few support classes.  The code in these is mostly
fairly short and shouldn't be hard to follow, but it would probably
take some hours to code these things from scratch.</p>

<p>
First, the class <a href="/Lab Work/Week 1/ReadPGM/">ReadPGM</a> has a static
read() method for reading an image file in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">PGM</a> format.
For simplicity it only works with a square image of given size, and
puts it's output in a given <tt>double [] []</tt> of greyscale values.
See the main method of this class for example usage of the read() method.</p>

<p>
The class <a href="/Lab Work/Week 1/DisplayDensity/">DisplayDensity</a> displays a
grey-scale representation of a "density" given in a <tt>double [] []</tt>
array.  By default, the smallest value in this array will be scaled to display
as black and the largest as white.</p>

<p>
The main method of ReadPGM also uses DisplayDensity to display the read
image, so you can immediately test both these classes by downloading
them and running ReadPGM.  You will also need a PGM image to read, and
there is one in this file: <a href="/Lab Work/Week 1/wolf.pgm">wolf.pgm</a>.  To make
thngs easier, ReadPGM by default reads from a file called "wolf.pgm",
but you may have to experiment with where you place this file in your
folder hierarchy - it depends on the Java development environment.
It needs to be in the working directory of the running Java program
(alternatively edit the code to give an absolute path name.)</p>

<p>
The wolf image is quite small.  You will soon discover why!</p>

<p>
The final support class I am going to provide you with is
<a href="/Lab Work/Week 1/Display2dFT/">Display2dFT</a>.  This is designed to
represent 2D Discrete Fourier Transforms.  The k,l components of these
are complex numbers, so the input to this class is two <tt>double [] []</tt>
arrays - one of real parts and one of imaginary parts.  The actual
display is quite hard to interpret because there isn't an obvious
way of representing complex numbers as pixels of an image.  It uses
a colour coding to represent the "direction" of the complex number in
the argand diagram.  The absolute size of the complex number is displayed
through brightness of the colour, using a logarithmic scale, because this
seems to work reasonably well for Fourier transforms.</p>

<p>
We will illustrate the use of Display2dFT shortly.</p>

<h2>Doing a Fourier Transform</h2>

<p>
To save more time I will give you the skeleton of a program to perform
a Discrete Fourier Transform:
</p><pre>  public class SimpleFT {
  
      public static int N = 256 ;
  
      public static void main(String [] args) throws Exception {
  
          double [] [] X = new double [N] [N] ;
          ReadPGM.read(X, "wolf.pgm", N) ;
  
          DisplayDensity display =
                  new DisplayDensity(X, N, "Original Image") ;
  
          double [] [] CRe = new double [N] [N], CIm = new double [N] [N] ;
  
          for(int k = 0 ; k &lt; N ; k++) {
              for(int l = 0 ; l &lt; N ; l++) {
                  double sumRe = 0, sumIm = 0 ;
                  // Nested for loops performing sum over X elements
                  for(int m = <span style="color:red">...</span>) {
                      for(int n = <span style="color:red">...</span>) {
                           double arg = <span style="color:red">...</span> ;
                           double cos = <span style="color:red">...</span> ;
                           double sin = <span style="color:red">...</span> ;
                           sumRe += cos * X [m] [n] ;
                           sumIm += <span style="color:red">...</span> ;
                      }
                  }
                  CRe [k] [l] = sumRe ;
                  CIm [k] [l] = sumIm ;
              }
              System.out.println("Completed FT line " + k + " out of " + N) ;
          }
  
          Display2dFT display2 =
                  new Display2dFT(CRe, CIm, N, "Discrete FT") ;
      }
  }
</pre>
Try to fill in the omitted code based on the first equation in slide 34 of this week's lecture.  It involves two nested loops over <i>m</i>
and <i>n</i> to do the sums in the equation over all elements of the
input pixels
in X.  Inside the loop you will need to calculate the argument <i>-2π(mk + nl)/N</i> of the imaginary exponential, and then use the Java sin and cos functions
to calculate the exponential according to the famous formulae on slide 27 (what effect does the minus sign in the exponent have here?)
Multiplication of the resulting complex number by X components is easy,
because X is a real number - it just scales the real and imaginary parts
independently.<p></p>

<p>
If you get this right, the program is likely to take a few minutes to run -
a problem we will fix in later weeks by using the Fast Fourier Transform
algorithm.</p>

<h2>Inverse Fourier Transform</h2>

<p>
Next we will confirm that we can recover exactly the original image
by inverting the transform on the represented in coefficients C.</p>

<p>
Add this skeleton code to the end of the main method above:
</p><pre>          double [] [] reconstructed = new double [N] [N] ;

          for(int m = 0 ; m &lt; N ; m++) {
              for(int n = 0 ; n &lt; N ; n++) {
                  double sum ;
                  <span style="color:red">... nested for loops performing sum over C elements</span>
                  reconstructed [m] [n] = sum ;
              }
              System.out.println("Completed inverse FT line " + m + " out of " + N) ;
          }

          DisplayDensity display3 =
                  new DisplayDensity(reconstructed, N, "Reconstructed Image") ;
</pre>
According to the second formula on slide 34, the code in the body of the
nested loops over <i>k</i> and <i>l</i> will have quite a similar structure
to the loop you wrote previously except:
<ul>
<li>
There is no minus sign in the argument of the imaginary exponential.</li>
<li>
In the earlier loop we multiplied the imaginary exponential by a real
number to obtain a complex number; here we will be multiplying together
<i>two</i> complex numbers, though we will ignore the imaginary part of
the result.  Actually the imaginary part should be zero, so we only need
to calculate the real part.</li>
</ul>
You can use the formula at the bottom of slide 26 to do this multiplication -
the product of complex numbers <i>a + bi</i> and <i>c + di</i>
has a real part of the form <i>ac - bd</i>, so a term in the sum will have a structure like
<tt>cos * CRe - sin * CIm</tt>.  But you need to fill in arguments and subscripts!<p></p>

<h2>Filtering Images with Fourier Transforms</h2>

<p>Many kinds of filter can be efficiently applied to images using
Fourier Transformed, including sophisticated filters based on
<i>convolutions</i>.  For the purposes of this lab we consider a very
simple kind of "low pass filter", where we simply omit Fourier components
with large wave numbers before reconstructing the image.</p>

<p>
In between the two code segments you wrote above, try adding these
lines:
</p><pre>          int cutoff = N/8 ;  // for example
          for(int k = 0 ; k &lt; N ; k++) {
              int kSigned = k &lt;= N/2 ? k : k - N ;
              for(int l = 0 ; l &lt; N ; l++) {
                  int lSigned = l &lt;= N/2 ? l : l - N ;
                  if(Math.abs(kSigned) &gt; cutoff || Math.abs(lSigned) &gt; cutoff) {
                      CRe [k] [l] = 0 ;
                      CIm [k] [l] = 0 ;
                  }
              }
          }

          Display2dFT display2a =
                  new Display2dFT(CRe, CIm, N, "Truncated FT") ;

</pre>
<!--
See slide 18 for the definition and significance of <i>k<sub>signed</sub></i>.
</p>
-->

<p>
For simplicity in the above code, we have applied Display2dFT twice to
the same array, and modified the array in between, which may lead to
some odd effects - hopefully they won't be confusing.</p>

<p>
You should also try implementing a high pass filter, for example by inverting
the test condition in the if statement above.</p>

<p>
By now you will see quite obviously why we only considered a small image
in this lab, and may be doubtful about the claim that the DFT can be used to
filter images "efficiently"!  Hopefully these doubts will be resolved
when we go on to consider the Fast Fourier Transform.</p>
