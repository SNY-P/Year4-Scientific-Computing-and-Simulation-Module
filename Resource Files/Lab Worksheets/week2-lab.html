<h1>Scientific Computing and Simulation, Lab 2: The Fast Fourier Transform</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
In the next couple of weeks I want to look
at the uses of Fourier analysis in filtering and reconstructing images -
I hope to cover examples from medical and astronomical imaging.
</p>

<p>
This week as a preliminary we will be looking at the Fast Fourier Transform,
and I will ask you to apply this to same image filtering task that took so
long to process last week, when we using a naive implementation of
the Discrete Fourier Transform.</p>

<h2>Implementation of an FFT</h2>

<p>
Although it shouldn't be too hard to implement a recursive version
of the Fast Fourier Transform, based for example on the formula on
slide 15 of this week's lecture, it is a little more challenging to
implement a fully optimized version of the FFT.  In particular,
for efficiency, it is preferable to unpick the recursion and produce a
purely iterative version of the same mathematics given in the slides.</p>

<p>
So instead I will provide you with the full Java code of a class FFT 
<a href="/Lab Work/Week 2/FFT/">here</a>.  Download it and import it into
Netbeans or your Java development environment of choice.</p>

<p>
The principal method of the class FFT is a static method called
<tt>fft1d</tt>, and the code of that method is reproduced here:
</p><pre>    public static void fft1d(double [] re, double [] im, int isgn) {

        // One-dimensional FFT, or inverse FFT (in-place algorithm).

        // When this method is called, the arrays re and im should contain
        // the real and imaginary parts of the input data.

        // When this method returns the values in these arrays are
        // are overwritten with the real and imaginary parts of the
        // transformed data.

        // isgn = +1 or -1 for forward or inverse transform.

        // Size of arrays should be a power or two.

        final double pi = Math.PI ;

        final int N = re.length ;  // im better be the same size

        bitReverse(re, im) ;

        int ln2   = ilog2(N)  ;  // Base 2 log of the leading dimension.

        // Danielson-Lanczos algorithm for FFT.

        for(int ilevel = 1 ; ilevel &lt;= ln2 ; ilevel++) {
            int le   = ipow(2,ilevel) ;
            int lev2 = le / 2 ;

            double uRe = 1.0F ;
            double uIm = 0.0F ;

            double wRe = Math.cos(isgn * pi / lev2) ;
            double wIm = Math.sin(isgn * pi / lev2) ;

            for(int jj = 0 ; jj &lt; lev2 ; jj++) {
                for(int ii = jj ; ii &lt; N ; ii += le) {
                    int jndex = ii + lev2 ;
                    int index = ii ;

                    //tmp      = u * a(jndex) ;
                    double tmpRe = uRe * re [jndex] - uIm * im [jndex] ;
                    double tmpIm = uRe * im [jndex] + uIm * re [jndex] ;

                    //a(jndex) = a(index) - tmp ;
                    re [jndex] = re [index] - tmpRe ;
                    im [jndex] = im [index] - tmpIm ;

                    //a(index) = a(index) + tmp ;
                    re [index] = re [index] + tmpRe ;
                    im [index] = im [index] + tmpIm ;
                }
                //tmp = u * w ;
                double tmpRe = uRe * wRe - uIm * wIm ;
                double tmpIm = uRe * wIm + uIm * wRe ;

                //u   = tmp ;
                uRe   = tmpRe ;
                uIm   = tmpIm ;
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
Barring changes to names of variables, and the
need in Java to unbundle complex numbers into real
and imaginary parts, this is <i>almost</i> identical to
pseudocode that at the time of writing is available on Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm#Data_reordering,_bit_reversal,_and_in-place_algorithms">here</a>
(under the heading "Data reordering, bit reversal, and in-place
algorithms" of the article "Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm").

<p>
One minor change is that in our version the nesting of the two innermost
loops is inverted.  Amongst other things this makes our code slightly more
economical in terms of computation of the twiddle factors.  A notable
feature of these codes is that the number of imaginary exponentials
(or trig functions) that have to be computed is quite minimal - one just
calculates the <span style="color:blue">log<sub>2</sub> <i>N</i></span>
imaginary exponentials with arguments minus or plus <i>2iπ/N</i>,
<i>4iπ/N</i>, <i>8iπ/N</i>, and so on, up to <i>iπ/2</i>.  These
are composed together using complex multiplication to get all other twiddle
factors.</p>

<p>
(By the way I didn't write this Java code myself from scratch.
I inheritted a FORTRAN FFT benchmark code quite a few years ago,
and transcribed that to Java for some demo.  There's nothing wrong
with code reuse!)</p>

<p>
Another feature of the code here is that it works "in place".
The same pair or arrays is used for the inputs or the outputs, and
the computed values of the Fourier transform replace the values
of the real space data in these arrays as the computation unfolds (or
vice versa for an inverse transform).</p>

<p>
In place algorithms are popular and valued in large scale computation,
because they can be used to save memory.  In our setting they
mean we do often have to define new arrays before calling the
methods, and copy the input data to the new arrays before calling 
the method.</p>

<h2>Lab Work - Using the FFT</h2>

<p>
Last week we performed a two dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform
on some image data, applied a trivial filter in Fourier space, then
performed an inverse DFT to recover the filtered image.</p>

<p>
This week I want you to do the same, using FFTs.</p>

<p>
Above I have given you the code for a <i>one dimensional FFT</i>; I
will leave it as an exercise to you to complete the two dimensional
FFT based on this code.</p>

<p>
This should be simpler than it may sound, using the observation on
slide 16 of the lecture that you can obtain an FFT of two dimensional
data just by performing a one dimensional FFT on all rows of the
data, followed by a one dimensional FFT on all columns of the data.</p>

<p>
Operationally, thinking of the two dimensional data as a (complex)
matrix, it is easier to do the FFT on all all rows, transpose the
matrix to swap rows and columns, do FFTs on all <i>rows</i> again,
then transpose the matrix back.
</p>

<p>
Like last week, let me give you the skeleton code for a Fourier
Transform and its inverse:
</p><pre>public class FFTImageFiltering {

    public static int N = 256 ;

    public static void main(String [] args) throws Exception {

        double [] [] X = new double [N] [N] ;
        ReadPGM.read(X, "wolf.pgm", N) ;

        DisplayDensity display =
                new DisplayDensity(X, N, "Original Image") ;

        // create array for in-place FFT, and copy original data to it
        double [] [] CRe = new double [N] [N], CIm = new double [N] [N] ;
        for(int k = 0 ; k &lt; N ; k++) {
            for(int l = 0 ; l &lt; N ; l++) {
                CRe [k] [l] = X [k] [l] ;
            }
        }

        fft2d(CRe, CIm, 1) ;  // Fourier transform

        Display2dFT display2 =
                new Display2dFT(CRe, CIm, N, "Discrete FT") ;

        // create array for in-place inverse FFT, and copy FT to it
        double [] [] reconRe = new double [N] [N],
                     reconIm = new double [N] [N] ;
        for(int k = 0 ; k &lt; N ; k++) {
            for(int l = 0 ; l &lt; N ; l++) {
                reconRe [k] [l] = CRe [k] [l] ;
                reconIm [k] [l] = CIm [k] [l] ;
            }
        }

        fft2d(reconRe, reconIm, -1) ;  // Inverse Fourier transform

        DisplayDensity display3 =
                new DisplayDensity(reconRe, N, "Reconstructed Image") ;
    }

    <span style="color:red">... implementation of fft2d ...</span>

}
</pre>
You "just" need to implement the static method <tt>fft2d</tt>, which
is an in place implementation of a two dimensional FFT.  The transform
is controlled by the final integer parameter - plus 1 means the forward
transform and -1 means the inverse transform.<p></p>

<p>
Don't panic! I have given you the non-trivial code for this, and according
to the discussion above the most challenging part remaining is probably
implementing an in place matrix transpose!</p>

<p>
I will even give you the general structure of that:
</p><pre>    static void transpose(double [] [] a) {

        for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
            for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; i ; j++) {
                 <span style="color:red">... swap values in a [i] [j] and a [j] [i] elements ...</span>
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
Now you need to complete implemention of this method:
<pre>    static void fft2d(double [] [] re, double [] [] im, int isgn) {

        // For simplicity, assume square arrays

        <span style="color:red">... fft1d on all rows of re, im ...</span>

        transpose(re) ;
        transpose(im) ;

        <span style="color:red">... fft1d on all rows of re, im ...</span>

        transpose(re) ;
        transpose(im) ;
    }
</pre>
Remember that in Java the <i>i</i>th row of a matrix, represented by
a <tt>double [] []</tt> array <tt>a</tt>, is just the one dimensional
array <tt>a [</tt><i>i</i><tt>]</tt>, which has type <tt>double []</tt>.
Use this to separately extract rows of real and imaginary arrays and
pass them as arguments to <tt>fft1d</tt>, in a loop over <i>i</i>.<p></p>

<p>
You should notice that the FFT version of the code is dramatically
faster than the original naive implementation.</p>

<p>
For a fully optimized production quality library for performing
Fourier transforms in "the wild", see, for example, <a href="http://www.fftw.org/">The Fastest Fourier Transform in the West</a>.

</p><h2>Exercises</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Benchmark your new implementation of the two dimensional Fourier
Transform and compare it with the naive code you produced before.
</li>
<li>
Complete the exercises suggested last week - experimenting with
the effects of different kinds of low pass and high pass filters
on the image.
</li>
<li>
(Optional) Experiment with larger images (which you will have to
source and load into the program). Please note that the image dimension (N) should be a square number. If it is not the case, the output of fft1d() won't be correct. 
</li>
<li>
(Optional) How could you make a parallel version of the two dimensional
FTT?
</li>
</ol>

      static int B = 10 ;  // base of arithmetic
  
      // Note top N/2 digits of factors should be zeroes
      static int [] X = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6} ;
      static int [] W = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 8} ;
  
      public static void main(String [] args) {
  
           double [] XRe = new double [N], XIm = new double [N] ;
           double [] WRe = new double [N], WIm = new double [N] ;

               XRe [i] = X [N - 1 - i] ;
               WRe [i] = W [N - 1 - i] ;
           }

           FFT.fft1d(WRe, WIm, 1) ;
  
           double [] YRe = new double [N], YIm = new double [N] ;
  
           // Convolution in Fourier space
           for(int k = 0 ; k < N ; k++) {
               YRe [k] = XRe [k] * WRe [k] - XIm [k] * WIm [k] ;
               YIm [k] = XRe [k] * WIm [k] + XIm [k] * WRe [k] ;
           }
  
           FFT.fft1d(YRe, YIm, -1) ;
  
           for(int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++) {    // Normalization
               YRe [i] /= N ;
           }
  
           int [] Y = new int [N] ;
  
           // Carry scan
  
           for(int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++) {
               int digit = (int) (YRe [i] + 0.5) ;
               Y [N - 1 - i] = digit % B ;
               if(i < N - 1) YRe [i + 1] += digit / B ;  // carry
           }
  
           System.out.print("Y = {") ;
           for(int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++) {
               System.out.print(Y [i] + (i < N - 1 ? ", " : "")) ;
           }
           System.out.println("}") ;
      }
  }
</pre>
Compare the output with the result of multiplying 
31,415,926 by 27,182,818 using a calculator.</p>

<p>
This is a phenomenally inefficient way of multiplying together two relatively small
integers, but for numbers with many thousand digits it becomes highly competitive, because
all stages other than the FFTs are <i>O(N)</i>, and the FFTs are only 
<span style="color:blue"><i>O(N</i> log<sub>2</sub> <i>N)</i></span>.</p>
