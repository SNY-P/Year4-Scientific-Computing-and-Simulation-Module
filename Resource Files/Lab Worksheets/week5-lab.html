<h1>Scientific Computing and Simulation, Lab 5: Lattice gas models</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
In this lab I want you to complete an implementation of the simplest
interesting Lattice Gas Model in two dimensions - the HPP model described
initially in the lecture.  I will also provide my own implementation
of the more complex FHP model, for you to experiment with.
</p>

<h2>A Lattice Gas on a square grid - the HPP model</h2>

<p>
As explained in the lecture, the Hardy, Pomeau and de Pazzis 
model is defined on a square grid.  This makes implementation of streaming
and collisions particularly simple, and I assume you shouldn't have
too much trouble implementing them in the time frame of this lab.</p>

<p>
Once again I will provide you with an outline program, including possible
code for initialization and display.  Please download the code at
<a href="/Lab Work/Week 5/HPP/">HPP.java</a>.
</p>

<p>
The main method of in the provided outline code looks like this:
</p><pre>    public static void main(String args []) throws Exception {

        // initialize - populate a subblock of grid
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; NX/4 ; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j &lt; NY/4 ; j++) {
                boolean [] fin_ij = fin [i] [j] ;
                for(int d = 0 ; d &lt; q ; d++) {
                    if(Math.random() &lt; DENSITY) {
                        fin_ij [d] = true ;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        display.repaint() ;
        Thread.sleep(DELAY) ;

        for(int iter = 0 ; iter &lt; NITER ; iter++) {

            // Collision

            for(int i = 0; i &lt; NX ; i++) {
                for(int j = 0; j &lt; NY ; j++) {
                    boolean [] fin_ij = fin [i] [j] ;
                    boolean [] fout_ij = fout [i] [j] ;

                    <span style="color:red">// default, no collisions case:

                    fout_ij [0] = fin_ij [0] ;
                    fout_ij [1] = fin_ij [1] ;
                    fout_ij [2] = fin_ij [2] ;
                    fout_ij [3] = fin_ij [3] ;

                    // please add collisions as per lecture!</span>
                }
            }

            // Streaming

            for(int i = 0; i &lt; NX ; i++) {
                int iP1 = (i + 1) % NX ;
                int iM1 = (i - 1 + NX) % NX ;
                for(int j = 0; j &lt; NY ; j++) {
                    int jP1 = (j + 1) % NY ;
                    int jM1 = (j - 1 + NY) % NY ;

                    <span style="color:red">// no streaming case:

                    fin [i] [j] [0] = fout [i] [j] [0] ;
                    fin [i] [j] [1] = fout [i] [j] [1] ;
                    fin [i] [j] [2] = fout [i] [j] [2] ;
                    fin [i] [j] [3] = fout [i] [j] [3] ;

                    // please add streaming as per lecture!</span>
                }
            }

            System.out.println("iter = " + iter) ;
            display.repaint() ;

            Thread.sleep(DELAY) ;
        }
    }
</pre>
I suggest you implement the streaming step first, as explained around
slide 15 in the lecture.  To make your life earlier I have precomputed
<i>i</i> and <i>j</i> (corresponding to <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>) indices
of neighbouring sites, under the assumption of wraparound at the edges
of the lattice.  The index arithmetic is identical to that given in 
the original Game of Life code you used in the Parallel Programming module.<p></p>

<p>
Before moving on to the collision stage, test and debug you streaming
code.</p>

<p>
When the streaming behaviour looks correct, fill in the collision code.
I have already given you pseudocode on slide 22 of the lecture.</p>

<p>
If it isn't obvious by inspection of the code running with the given
initial conditions whether particles are behaving as they should, you
can set up initial conditions with (e.g.) just two particles, where you
stage collisions.  For example replace initalization code above by just:
</p><pre>        // initialize - staged head on collision in x direction.
        fin [NX/2 + 1] [NY/2] [0] = true ;
        fin [NX/2 - 1] [NY/2] [1] = true ;
</pre>
You may want to increase the value of <tt>DELAY</tt> so you can see
what is going on here.
Staging such collisions amounts to a kind of "unit testing" of the
collision code.
<p></p>

<p>
Once you are confident streaming and collision are working as intended,
you may want to experiment with slightly different initial conditions,
controlled by the ranges of the initialization loop and the <tt>DENSITY</tt>
parameter.
</p>

<p>
If you preferred the colour scheme in the lecture, with arrows in different
directions coloured differently, comment/uncomment the appropriate
<tt>setColor</tt> commands in the <i>Display</i> class.
</p>

<h2>An approach to coding the FHP model</h2>

<p>The more realistic 2d models on triangular lattices present more of
a challenge in terms of coding.  Given the time available, I have simply
provided some code for you to inspect and experiment with in this class <a href="/Lab Work/Week 5/FHP/">FHP.java</a>.

</p><p>
The triangular lattice is generated from two unit-length "basis vectors"
with <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> components [1, 0] and [0.5, 0.5 sqrt(3)] respectively,
as illustrated here:</p>
<p>
<img src="./week5-lab_files/Triangular-lattice.png" height="300">
</p>
Most of the non-trivial geometry here is encoded in the <i>Display</i>
class and also in the streaming code.<p></p>

<p>
The states 0 and 1 correspond to motion in negative and positive directions
the horizontal (<b>b</b><sup>(1)</sup>) direction.  The states 2 and 3
correspond to motion in the negative and positive <b>b</b><sup>(2)</sup>
directions.  The states 4 and 5 correspond to motion indicated by the
yellow and green arrows in the figure above.  (For avoidance of confusion,
note that in the figure above and all figures in the PowerPoint slides
the y dimension increases <i>upwards</i>; on the display generated by
the program the y dimension increases <i>downwards</i> - unfortunately
you have to mentally invert going between figures and program display.)</p>

<p>
The implication of this for the streaming step is that whilst the streaming
of states 0 through 3 are much as in the HPP case, that for states 4 and
5 is more complicated.  Note in the figure above how these states connect
site (2, 2), for example, to (1, 3) and (3, 1).</p>

<p>
The collision step, whilst considerably more complicated than the HPP
case, because of the much larger number of collistion types to consider,
is not much affected by the geometry beyond knowing state 0 is opposite
state 1, etc.  The three way collisions need slightly more careful thought.
To convince yourself they are correct - in accordance with slide 27 of the
lecture - you may want to try "unit test" cases like this:
</p><pre>        // initialize - staged three way collision
        fin [NX/2 - 1] [NY/2] [1] = true ;
        fin [NX/2] [NY/2 + 1] [2] = true ;
        fin [NX/2 + 1] [NY/2 - 1] [5] = true ;
</pre>
for the initial conditions.<p></p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>Experiment further with these codes.</p>

<p>
To get something more like recognizable fluid dynamics you might want
to strip out the elaborate plotting of arrow-like triangles to display
the full state, and just display the particle densities at points as
calculated on slide 11 of the lecture, on some kind of grey scale.
Even better, average this density over small groups of neighbouring
cells.  You should then be able to move to simulations on much larger
lattices.</p>

<p>
Encoding the local state in terms of a short array of boolean variables
isn't necessary the best way of doing things.  A more efficient way
is usually to encode the local velocity states in terms of the bits of a single
<tt>int</tt> variable, and use bitwise operations for manipulating them.
By analogy with similar techniques used in computational statistical
physics this is sometimes called <i>multi-spin encoding</i>.
How would you change the HPP code, for example, to use this technique?
