<h1>Scientific Computing and Simulation, Lab 10: Solution of Differential Equations</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
A relatively brief lab this week, to familiarize you with some basics of integrating ordinary differential equations.</p>

<p>
For a change we will use Python this week.  Python is in practice more widely
used for scientific computing than Java, and as a result has many excellent
libraries and software packages available to specifically support
scientific applications.  In particular this week we will use part of
<a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>.</p>

<p>
The scripts I give below have been designed to run under a Jupyter Notebook.
Probably the easiest way to run Jupyter in the labs or at home will be by
installing <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> (it is available
through AppsAnywhere, or free for home installation).</p>

<p>
You may in addition need to install the packages <i>scipy</i> and
<i>matplotlib</i>, perhaps using conda.</p>

<h2>Using the <i>scipy.integrate</i> packages</h2>

<p>
The example we will consider in this lab is Newton's equations of
motion for motion of two bodies around one another under the force
of gravity.  Many of You will have seen rather more complex code for
similar motion of <i>thousands</i> of bodies in the Parallel Programming
module last term (for example in the star simulation project idea).
But the motivation here is just to familiarize
ourselves with and compare integration methods on a simple example.</p>

<p>
Paste the following Python script into Jupyter or your preferred
Python platform (the final lines displaying of the animation will probably
need adaptation for platforms other than Jupyter).
</p><pre>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation
import numpy as np

import scipy.integrate

m1 = 1
(x1, y1) = (1.0, 0.0)
(vx1, vy1) = (0, 0.2)

m2 = 2
(x2, y2) = (-0.5, 0.0)
(vx2, vy2) = (0, -0.1)

def grav(x1, y1, x2, y2):   
    # inverse square law between two particles mass m1, m2
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    r2 = dx * dx + dy * dy
    r3 = r2 ** 1.5
    fx = dx / r3
    fy = dy / r3
    return (fx/m1, fy/m1, -fx/m2, -fy/m2)

rs = [x1, y1, x2, y2]
vs = [vx1, vy1, vx2, vy2]
y = rs + vs

def fun(t, y):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2, vx1, vy1, vx2, vy2) = tuple(y)
    (ax1, ay1, ax2, ay2) = grav(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    return [vx1, vy1, vx2, vy2, ax1, ay1, ax2, ay2]

res = scipy.integrate.solve_ivp(fun, (0, 50), y)
ts = res.t
ys = res.y

fig = plt.figure(figsize=[6,6])
ax = plt.axes([0., 0., 1., 1.], xlim=(-1.5,1.5), ylim=(-1.5,1.5))
ax.set_aspect('equal')
ax.axis('off')
l = ax.scatter([x1, x2], [y1, y2], c=['blue', 'red'], s=[4, 8])

def animate(i):
    l.set_offsets(np.reshape(ys [0:4, i], (2,2)))

ani = matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames=len(ts))

from IPython.display import HTML
HTML(ani.to_jshtml())
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Apart from the import directives, the top part of the code, to the
end of the definition of the function <t>grav</t>, is concerned with
initial conditions and definition the auxilliary function that calculates
the accelerations due to gravitational force between two bodies.</p>

<p>
The bodies have masses <tt>m1</tt> and <tt>m2</tt>, their 2D positions
are respectively <tt>(x1, y1)</tt> and <tt>(x2, y2)</tt>, and their
respective velocites are  <tt>(vx1, vy1)</tt> and <tt>(vx2, vy2)</tt>.</p>

<p>
Note that this means we have altogether eight independent variables, and
there initial values are collected together in the list <tt>y</tt>.</p>

<p>
The vector valued function (corresponding to <i>f</i> in this weeks lecture)
that defines the system of equations is implemented by the Python function
<i>fun</i>.</p>

<p>
The one-line heart of the script, which integrates the equations of motion,
is the call to <i>scipy.integrate.solve_ivp</i>.  We pass it the function
<i>fun</i>, the initial and final values of time (0 and 50), and the
initial values of the dependent variables.  That's it.</p>

<p>
Read the documentation <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html">here</a> to learn more about
how this function works and its capabilites.</p>

<p>
The remainder of the script is about plotting the motion of the bodies
over the period of integration (in Java we were able to plot computational
updates on the fly as they were performed - I haven't yet found an easy
way to do this in Python - none that works in Jupyter, anyway)</p>

<p>
In the initial call to <i>scatter</i>, the arguments <tt>c</tt> and
<tt>s</tt> just define the size of the two individual points in the plot.
Other arguments may be more obvious.</p>

<p>
If you run this script it may take a little while to do the computation
and create the animation, before you can actually view it.</p>

<p>
When you do so you should see the two bodies orbiting one another for
some number of orbits.  Notice that eventually the size of the orbits
starts to decay - energy is being lost from the simulated system.  This
is not something that would happen in real life.</p>

<h2>Using the Velocity Verlet algorithm</h2>

<p>
So far as I can see <i>scipy.integrate</i> doesn't implement the Leapfrog
method or the equivalent Velocity Verlet algorithm.  In fact these algorithms
are
sufficiently simple that most people would probably implement them inline
in their simulation code, which is what they do below:
</p><pre>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation
import numpy as np

m1 = 1
(x1, y1) = (1.0, 0.0)
(vx1, vy1) = (0, 0.2)

m2 = 2
(x2, y2) = (-0.5, 0.0)
(vx2, vy2) = (0, -0.1)

def grav(x1, y1, x2, y2):   
    # inverse square law between two particles mass m1, m2
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    r2 = dx * dx + dy * dy
    r3 = r2 ** 1.5
    fx = dx / r3
    fy = dy / r3
    return (fx/m1, fy/m1, -fx/m2, -fy/m2)

t=0
tend=50
dt = 0.01
NITER = int((tend - t)/dt + 0.5)

ys = np.zeros((4, NITER + 1))
ys [:, 0] = [x1, y1, x2, y2]

(ax1, ay1, ax2, ay2) = grav(x1, y1, x2, y2)
for i in range(NITER):
    vx1 += 0.5 * dt * ax1
    vy1 += 0.5 * dt * ay1
    vx2 += 0.5 * dt * ax2
    vy2 += 0.5 * dt * ay2
    x1 += dt * vx1
    y1 += dt * vy1
    x2 += dt * vx2
    y2 += dt * vy2
    (ax1, ay1, ax2, ay2) = grav(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    vx1 += 0.5 * dt * ax1
    vy1 += 0.5 * dt * ay1
    vx2 += 0.5 * dt * ax2
    vy2 += 0.5 * dt * ay2
    ys [:, i+1] = [x1, y1, x2, y2]

fig = plt.figure(figsize=[6,6])
ax = plt.axes([0., 0., 1., 1.], xlim=(-1.5,1.5), ylim=(-1.5,1.5))
ax.set_aspect('equal')
ax.axis('off')
l = ax.scatter([x1, x2], [y1, y2], c=['blue', 'red'], s=[4, 8])

OUTPUT_FREQ=10 # display every 10 steps only

def animate(i):
    l.set_offsets(np.reshape(ys [0:4, OUTPUT_FREQ * i], (2,2)))

ani = matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames=int(NITER/OUTPUT_FREQ))

from IPython.display import HTML
HTML(ani.to_jshtml())
</pre>
We now have to do more work in terms of choosing the step <i>h</i>
(called <tt>dt</tt> in the program) and computing the implied
number of iterations.<p></p>

<p>
The fixed value of 0.01 is presumably smaller than the Runge Kutta
method uses, but I found that any larger step led to "loss" of particles
when they hit perigee and were moving fastest.</p><p>

</p><p>
Nevertheless what you should see is that while the orbits may
"precess" unphysically, they don't decay - some evidence perhaps
that energy is being conserved.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>Experiment with these codes, adjusting initial conditions and integration
time step for the Velocity Verlet case (you should be able to discover
the time step for the SciPi RK4 algorithm restrospectively by inspecting
the output array <tt>ts</tt>.
You can control it by specifying a tolerance.)</p>

<!--
<p>
If you are significantly more adventurous, try adding more particles.
This of course will require substantial changes to the code that
computes the gravitational acceleration - it becomes an N-body problem
(although I don't particularly advocate going beyond N=3 or so by this
method!)
