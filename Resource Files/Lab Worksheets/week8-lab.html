<h1>Scientific Computing and Simulation, Lab 8: An Attempted Application to Aerodynamics</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
In terms of coding, this week's lab is a modest extension of the Lattice
Boltzmann program you experimented with last week.</p>

<p>After this week's lecture you should have an improved understanding of
how boundary conditions work for Lattice Boltzmann models.  We will use
this to consider the forces on an aircraft wing.  In this we are somewhat
restricted by achievable Reynolds Numbers (see lecture), but hopefully
the results are illustrative.</p>

<h2>Boundary Conditions Revisited</h2>

<p>
This main code for this is a slightly extended version of last week's.
Please download the class <a href="/Lab Work/Week 8/Airfoil/">Airfoil</a>.</p>

<p>
Before looking at the new sections in the code, mostly related to
a more elaborate definition of the obstacle profile, revisit the
sections related to boundary conditions, which we skimmed over last
week.</p><p>

</p><p>
The most important such section from the point of view of this week's
work is the imposition of <i>no-slip</i> conditions at the obstacle,
by means of a <i>bounce-back</i> scheme.  Buried in the collision code
you should find this loop:
</p><pre>        // BC - no slip at obstacle
        for(int d = 0; d &lt; Q ; d++) {
            fout_ij [d] = fin_ij [noslip [d]] ;
        }
</pre>
This simply replaces the normal collision step inside the obstacle by
a step that replaces each distribution component by the value of the
component with the opposite velocity state (this is how the program
variable <tt>noslip</tt> is defined earlier in the code:
<pre>        int [] noslip = new int [Q] ;  // index in c of negative velocity state
        for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; Q ; i++) {
            int [] cEl = c [i] ;
            for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; Q ; j++) {
                int [] cElj = c [j] ;
                if(cElj [0] == -cEl [0] &amp;&amp; cElj [1] == -cEl [1]) {
                    noslip [i] = j ;
                }
            }
        }
</pre>
).<p></p>

<p>
As we have noted in the lecture, this inversion only really needs to be
applied at boundary cells of the obstacle that are in contact with the fluid.
But no harm is done by applying it throughout the region of the obstacle -
it just implies that any populations of particles inside the obstacle
region bounce back and forth between neighbouring cels, exchanging
no net particle number or momentum with the fluid.</p>

<p>
The boundary condition at the inlet on the left-hand side of the simulation
region is accounted for by the following two sections of code - this
in the calculation of macroscopic quantities:
</p><pre>            // BC - left wall: compute density from known
            // populations.

            u_ij [0] = vel [j] [0] ;
            u_ij [1] = vel [j] [1] ;
            float sum2 = 0 ;
            for(int d : i2) {
               sum2 += fin_ij [d] ;
            }
            float sum1 = 0 ;
            for(int d : i1) {
               sum1 += fin_ij [d] ;
            }
            rho [0] [j] = 1/(1 - u_ij [0]) * (sum2 + 2 * sum1) ;
</pre>
and this in the collision step:
<pre>            // BC - left wall: Zou/He boundary condition.
            if(i == 0) {
                for(int p = 0 ; p &lt; 3 ; p++) {
                    int d = i3 [p] ;
                    fin_ij [d] = fin_ij [noslip [d]] +
                                 feq [d] -
                                 feq [noslip [d]] ;
                }
            }
</pre>
In the initialization code the three arrays <tt>i1</tt>, <tt>i2</tt> and
<tt>i3</tt> are defined to contain the three indices of each of state with
respectively negative, zero, and positive velocity components in the
<i>x</i>-direction.  The first section above applies the formula from
slide 10 of the lecture.  The second section applies the Zou-He boundary
conditions as described on slide 13.  Since there is no vertical
(<i>y</i>-component) of velocity at the inlet, the <i>transverse 
momentum correction</i> is zero here.<p></p>

<p>
Finally these lines after normal streaming:
</p><pre>            // BC - Right wall: outflow condition
            for(int d : i1) {
                for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; NY ; j++) {
                    fin [NX - 1] [j] [d] = fin [NX - 2] [j] [d] ;
                }
            }
</pre>
adequately implement an open boundary condition at the outlet of the
flow.  Although they unphysically reflect sound waves during the
early settling stages of the of simulation, they don't seem to cause
problems once the simulation has settled down.<p></p>

<h2>Lattice Boltzmann flow over an Aerofoil</h2>

<p>
The goal in this week's lecture is to explore the lift and drag forces
on a notional aircraft wing, at least in so far as these can be
recreated by our LBM simulation.</p>

<p>
The profile of a realistic aerofoil is slightly more complex to set up
than a simple cylindrical obstacle.  I chose to implement an aerofoil
from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)
"four-digit series" of aerofoils that are quite well described by this
Wikipedia article:
</p><pre>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil</a>
</pre>
The method <tt>y_t()</tt> in my code calculates the profile of an
unrealistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil#Equation_for_a_symmetrical_4-digit_NACA_airfoil">symmetrical aerofoil</a>
with no "camber".  A symmetrical
aerofoil has the same profile for the top and bottom surface, and looks
more like a bullet than a familiar aerofoil.  Then this symmetrical
shape is "bent" around a camber curve that is normally convex upwards,
to yield a more traditional looking aerofoil with a more curved upper
surface and a flatter lower surface.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil#Equation_for_a_cambered_4-digit_NACA_airfoil">formula for the camber curve</a>
is implemented by the method <tt>y_c()</tt> in my code, and the slightly
intricate equations for the operation of bending the initial
symmetric aerofoil around the camber are solved in the method
<tt>naca4415()</tt>, which also makes use of the method
<tt>theta()</tt>.<p></p>

<p>
The name of the former method indicates that the
exact aerofoil from the four digit series I am calculating is NACA 4415.
If you are interested you can find some details relating to this specific
aerofoil here:
</p><pre>  <a href="http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=naca4415-il">http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=naca4415-il</a>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Finally we can set up the obstacle for our flow.  If a horizontal
aerofoil was sufficient, the code for this could be as simple as this:
</p><pre>        // Horizontal airfoil obstacle (r is half chord length)
        double [] ys = new double [2];
        for(int k = 0; k &lt;= 2 * r; k++) {
            double x = k / (2 * r);
            naca4415(ys, x);
            int i = (int) (cx - r + k + 0.5);
            for(int j = (int) (cy - 2 * r * ys [1] + 0.5) ;
                    j &lt;= (int) (cy - 2 * r * ys [0] + 0.5) ; j++) {
                obstacle [i] [j] = true ;
            }
        }
</pre>
We will shortly see that in practise the aerofoil needs to be tilted into
the incoming flow by an <i>angle of attack</i>, usually called <i>alpha</i>.
So we have to apply a rotation matrix as follows:
<pre>        // Airfoil obstacle (r is half chord length)
        final double ALPHA = 0 ;  // angle of attack in degrees
        double rad = Math.PI * ALPHA / 180 ;
        double cos = Math.cos(rad) ;
        double sin = Math.sin(rad) ;
        double [] ys = new double [2] ;
        for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; NX ; i++) {
            for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; NY ; j++) {
                // rotate about [(cx - r), cy]
                double x2r = (i - cx + r) * cos + (j - cy) * sin ;
                double y2r = - (i - cx + r) * sin + (j - cy) * cos ;

                double x = x2r / (2 * r) ;
                if(x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 1) {
                    naca4415(ys, x) ;
                    obstacle [i] [j] = y2r &gt; (- 2 * r * ys [1]) &amp;&amp;
                                       y2r &lt; (- 2 * r * ys [0]) ;
                }
            }
        }
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Finally, around the code that implements the bounce-back boundary
conditions at the obstacle we have added code to calculate the
momentum transferred to the obstacle in a single time step.
You will remember that momentum per unit time is force, so these
lines of code calculate the force exerted by the fluid on the obstacle
in the x and y directions.  The code is like this:
</p><pre>        double xPre = - fin_ij [3] - fin_ij [4] - fin_ij [5]
                      + fin_ij [6] + fin_ij [7] + fin_ij [8] ;

        double yPre = - fin_ij [1] + fin_ij [2] - fin_ij [4]
                      + fin_ij [5] - fin_ij [7] + fin_ij [8] ;

        // BC - no slip at obstacle
        for(int d = 0; d &lt; Q ; d++) {
            fout_ij [d] = fin_ij [noslip [d]] ;
        }

        double xPost =
                - fout_ij [3] - fout_ij [4] - fout_ij [5]
                + fout_ij [6] + fout_ij [7] + fout_ij [8] ;

        double yPost =
                - fout_ij [1] + fout_ij [2] - fout_ij [4]
                + fout_ij [5] - fout_ij [7] + fout_ij [8] ;

        momXtoObstacle += xPre - xPost ;
        momYtoObstacle += yPre - yPost ;
</pre>

<h2>Running the Code</h2>

<p>
Run the <tt>Airfoil</tt> code as provided.  It is set up to run 50,000
iterations, but if you are impatient you can probably reduce this a
little.</p>

<p>
As the code runs it will print out an accumulating average of the
<i>x</i>-direction and <i>y</i>-direction forces on the wing.
In terminology you may be familar with the horizontal force is the
<i>drag</i> on the wing, and the vertical force is
the <i>lift</i> produced by the aerofoil.</p>

<p>
The code as provided has an angle of attack of zero.  You may or may
not be surprised to discover that a horizontal aerofoil produces
lift close to zero.</p>

<p>
(If you wonder why the code that prints out the lift has a minus sign,
it is just because we work in conventional graphics coordinates where
<i>y</i> goes <i>down</i> the page.  The aerofoil on the other hand has been
oriented to produce lift going "upwards".)</p>


<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>Experiment further with different angles of attack (<tt>ALPHA</tt>).
For a real wing using this aerofoil something in the range of 9 degrees
may be optimal.  For various reasons discussed below our simulation
is not realistic, and higher or lower angles may give optimal drag (low)
and lift (high).
</p>

<h2>POSTSCRIPT</h2>

<p>
Real aircraft wings operate at a much higher Reynolds Number (lower viscosity)
than we can achieve with our pretty basic Lattice Boltzmann program.
I believe Reynolds Numbers for real aircraft may range from between 50,000
to a million or more.  Our program will become unstable for numbers much
higher than about a thousand.</p>

<p>
I was unable to observe lift-to-drag ratios much greater than about two.
If a real aircraft had to deal with such low ratios it would probably
need a great deal of engine power to overcome the drag and produce
adequate lift.  Superficial research suggest real aircraft are
operating with lift-to-drag ratios somewhere between about 5 and 20.</p>

<p>
Lower Reynolds number corresponds to higher viscosity.  It may be that
this leads to higher drag, and that accounts for our lower ratios.  On the
positive side - we do see lift!</p>
