# Year 4: Scientific Computing & Simulation Module

This repo contains the work that has been done for my 4th year scientific computing and visualisation module. The files will be sectioned into 3: the [Lab Work](/Lab%20Work/), the [Mini-Project](/Mini-Project/) and the [Resource Files](/Resource%20Files/).

## Lab Work
The lab work consists of 9 lab sheets, Week 1 - Week 9. Week 1 - Week 3 were mainly focused on Fourier Transforms whereas Week 4 - Week 9 were focused on simulating the given programs and changing different parameter to observe different outcomes.
- [Week 1](/Lab%20Work/Week%201/): An introduction to Fourier Transforms, Inverse Fourier Transforms and Image Filtering. The code will be a naive 2D Discrete Fourier Transform.
- [Week 2](/Lab%20Work/Week%202/): An introduction to Fast Fourier Transforms and applying it to image filtering of Week 1.
- [Week 3](/Lab%20Work/Week%203/): Recovering the original image from a sinogram (Radon transform).
- [Week 4](/Lab%20Work/Week%204/): Observing the simulation of radio interferometry data.
- [Week 5](/Lab%20Work/Week%205/): Implementation of the Lattice Gas Model in two dimensions, HPP model, and experimenting with FHP model.
- [Week 6](/Lab%20Work/Week%206/): Implementing and experimenting with cellular automata, excitable media and GerhardtSchusterTyson model for cardiac tissue.
- [Week 7](/Lab%20Work/Week%207/): Experiment with a sample of the Lattice Boltzmann model simulating two-dimensional fluid flow around a cylindrical obstacle.
- [Week 8](/Lab%20Work/Week%208/): An extension of the Lattice Boltzmann model experiment by learning how boundary conditions work for the model and it will be used to consider the forces, drag and lift, on an aircraft wing.
- [Week 9](/Lab%20Work/Week%209/): Familiarisation of integrating ordinary differential equations

## Mini-Project
The [mini-project](/Mini-Project/), that was undertaken for the second half of the coursework, was an experimentation of Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART) for reconstruction of CT scan images.
